# SkiConnect Architecture

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Spring Boot and follows a layered architecture:

### 1. Presentation Layer (Controllers)
- `UserController`: Handles user management endpoints
- `PlaceController`: Manages place-related operations
- `LessonController`: Handles lesson availability and booking
- `SearchController`: Provides search functionality for schools and teachers

### 2. Service Layer
- Base Services:
  - `BaseService`: Generic service interface
  - `BaseServiceImpl`: Generic service implementation
- Domain Services:
  - `UserService`/`UserServiceImpl`: User management
  - `SchoolService`/`SchoolServiceImpl`: School operations
  - `TeacherService`/`TeacherServiceImpl`: Teacher management
  - `PlaceService`/`PlaceServiceImpl`: Place operations
  - `LessonAvailabilityService`/`LessonAvailabilityServiceImpl`: Lesson availability management

### 3. Repository Layer
- JPA repositories for each domain entity
- Extends Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository`
- Handles data persistence and retrieval

### 4. Domain Layer
- `User`: User entity with roles and authentication
- `School`: School entity with teacher associations
- `Teacher`: Teacher entity with school and lesson associations
- `Place`: Location entity for schools and teachers
- `LessonAvailability`: Lesson scheduling and availability
- `Role`: User role enumeration
- `Lesson`: Lesson entity
- `SearchResponse`: Search result DTO

### 5. Configuration
- `SecurityConfig`: Spring Security configuration with role-based access
- `OpenApiConfig`: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation setup

## Frontend Architecture (Planned)

The frontend will be built with Vite, TypeScript, and React, following a modern component-based architecture:

### 1. Technology Stack
- Vite: Build tool and development server
- TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript
- React: UI component library
- React Router: Client-side routing
- Axios: HTTP client for API communication
- Material-UI: Component library
- Redux Toolkit: State management

### 2. Project Structure
```

│   ├── api/           # API client and endpoints
│   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/         # Page components

└── package.json       # Dependencies
```

### 3. Key Features

### 2. Data Flow
1. Frontend makes API request
2. Backend validates request
3. Business logic processing
4. Database operations
5. Response formatting
6. Frontend state update

### 3. Security

- Role-based access control
- HTTPS encryption
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### 4. Development Workflow
1. Backend API development
2. OpenAPI documentation
3. Frontend type generation
4. Frontend implementation
5. Integration testing
6. Deployment

## Testing and Code Quality

### 1. Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests: Testing individual components in isolation
- Integration Tests: Testing component interactions
- End-to-End Tests: Testing complete user workflows
- Test Coverage: Measured using JaCoCo

### 2. Code Quality Tools
- SpotBugs: Static code analysis for bug detection
- Code Style: Consistent coding standards
- Code Reviews: Peer review process
- Continuous Integration: Automated testing and quality checks

### 3. Test Coverage Reports
- JaCoCo integration for code coverage metrics
- Coverage thresholds for critical components
- Regular monitoring of coverage trends
- Coverage reports in CI/CD pipeline

### 4. Code Quality Metrics
- Bug detection with SpotBugs
- Code complexity analysis
- Maintainability index
- Technical debt tracking

## Deployment Architecture
